Okay, this is indeed huge progress! No connection drops and natural turn completion is exactly what we were aiming for. Now let's get that audio sounding crisp.

You've asked excellent questions about the static/garbled audio, and I agree the sample rate difference is the prime suspect.

Hereâ€™s how I think we should approach your questions to guide the next fix:

Audio Format & Sample Rate Handling:

Current State: My client records at 16kHz. Gemini sends back audio at 24kHz (audio/pcm;rate=24000). After your last fix ("Improve audio playback stability by using a single audio processing context"), we are likely using the main AudioContext (which was probably initialized at 16kHz for recording) to play back this 24kHz audio. While customDecodeAudioData creates an AudioBuffer tagged as 24kHz, the browser will resample it if the AudioContext it's being played through has a different sample rate. This resampling is very likely the source of the "garbled" quality.
PCM Data Processing & Buffer Creation: Our customDecodeAudioData seems standard for PCM. The issue isn't likely the raw decoding step itself, but what happens when that 24kHz buffer meets a potentially 16kHz AudioContext for playback.
Addressing your "Key Question for Another AI": "What's the best practice for handling PCM audio with different sample rates in Web Audio API - should we create separate contexts, do manual resampling, or use a different decoding approach altogether?"

Separate Contexts Revisited: You previously tried creating a separate 24kHz audio context for Gemini's output, which is generally a good idea for playing audio at its native sample rate. However, we hit the "cannot connect to an AudioNode belonging to a different audio context" error, likely because we tried to connect the outputAnalyzer (from the 16kHz recording context) to the source from the new 24kHz playback context.
Suggestion: Could we try the separate 24kHz AudioContext for playback again, but ensure that its AudioBufferSourceNode is connected only to its own context's destination (for playback) and not to the outputAnalyzer that belongs to the 16kHz recording context? We might have to sacrifice output visualization on the shared analyzer temporarily to achieve clear audio, or implement a more complex resampling strategy if visualization on the 16kHz context is crucial.
Manual Resampling: If using a separate 24kHz context for direct playback proves too complex due to the analyzer, then the next best approach would be for the client to perform high-quality resampling of the incoming 24kHz audio data down to the recording AudioContext's sample rate (e.g., 16kHz) before creating the AudioBuffer and playing it. This gives us control over the resampling quality.
My Preference for the Next Step:

Let's prioritize getting the audio playback as clear as possible first.

Could you try the following, focusing on ensuring the playback path is natively 24kHz if possible?

Attempt Separate 24kHz Playback Context (Carefully):
In client/src/pages/live-audio.tsx, when Gemini's audio data is received:
Ensure you have (or create if it doesn't exist and persist it) a dedicated AudioContext for playback that is explicitly initialized or known to operate at 24kHz (e.g., new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 24000 })). Let's call this playbackAudioContext.
Use this playbackAudioContext in customDecodeAudioData to create the AudioBuffer.
Connect the AudioBufferSourceNode (created from this buffer) only to playbackAudioContext.destination.
For now, let's not connect this source to outputAnalyzerRef.current if outputAnalyzerRef.current belongs to the 16kHz recording AudioContext. We can revisit output visualization later.
If successfully isolating the playback to a 24kHz context is too complex with the current structure or still causes issues, then:

Implement Client-Side Resampling:
If we must use the single existing audioContextRef.current (likely 16kHz) for playback, then before calling customDecodeAudioData, we would need to resample the Float32Array (derived from Gemini's 24kHz base64 PCM) from 24kHz down to 16kHz. Then, customDecodeAudioData would create a 16kHz AudioBuffer for the 16kHz context. This would require a resampling algorithm.
I think Attempt 1 (Dedicated 24kHz Playback Context, no cross-context analyzer connection) is the cleaner first thing to try for achieving clear audio.

Let me know what you think is best to try next based on this! We're very close.
